No worries! Let's walk through it step-by-step to make sure everything is working with your new IP (13.53.131.60).

âœ… Checklist to Get Your Calculator History Working:
1. Update IP in cal.js
Open your cal.js file and replace all old IPs (13.60.52.163) with the new IP (13.53.131.60):

js
Copy
Edit
fetch("http://13.53.131.60:3000/api/history")
and for the POST request:

js
Copy
Edit
fetch("http://13.53.131.60:3000/api/history", {
Make sure these URLs are updated correctly.

2. Restart Your Node.js Server
Stop any running instance and restart the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
pkill node
nohup node server.js &
This ensures the Node.js app is running fresh with the updated config.

3. Check EC2 Security Group Settings
Go to your AWS EC2 instance â†’ Security Groups:

âœ… Inbound Rule:

Type: Custom TCP

Port: 3000

Source: 0.0.0.0/0 or your IP

Make sure port 3000 is open.

4. Verify Backend is Running
Try this on your EC2 instance:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:3000/api/history
If this works and gives you a [] or some data, your backend is good.

Then try this from your browser (on your laptop):

bash
Copy
Edit
http://13.53.131.60:3000/api/history
If that doesn't load, itâ€™s most likely a security group issue or the backend didnâ€™t start properly.

5. Clear Browser Cache (optional but helpful)
Sometimes old JS files are cached. Do a hard refresh:

Windows: Ctrl + F5

Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

If you're still not seeing anything or getting errors, send me:

The current error in the browser console

Output of: curl http://localhost:3000/api/history from your EC2
